:zap: ¤ Damn Larper is a multipurpose bot with many commands and features. It is basically a text-based game right in your server! This bot has a verification system, which is not allowing the unverified to send messages until they verify themselves. Besides verification, there are also moderation commands such as ban and kick commands. 

In case you're searching for a fun bot, there are categories of commands for economy, custom text commands, miscellaneous commands, levelling system, bump system in development, list system with which you can make your own list and for example write down your chores on them. 

And it's not over yet, you can basically take care of your virtual pet! You can get one at a petshop (it helps you gain sweet bonuses on economy commands!). There's also roleplaying, where you can buy items, craft items, go mining, hunting, fishing and chopping wood - in basic terms, get resources and be a boss (there are command cooldowns though, get premium to avoid them!). 

You can also unlock achievements and get spectacular rewards once you complete them! Regarding to server security, there is a anti-raid and security system which is customizeable! There is also social media-like system where you can post messages and view them on a global feed. More features are waiting you once you add Damn Larper to your server!

## Building from source

1. Install the latest PAWN compiler [here](https://github.com/pawn-lang/compiler)...
2. Install standard SA:MP library package [here](https://github.com/pawn-lang/samp-stdlib)...
3. Install standard PAWN library package [here](https://github.com/pawn-lang/pawn-stdlib)...
4. Install Discord Connector plugin for PAWN [here](https://github.com/maddinat0r/samp-discord-connector)...
5. Compile your script with `pawncc`.
6. Run your script with your open.mp/SA:MP server.

### Sublime Text
If you are using ST3, use `pawn.sublime-build` to run the compiler:
```json
{
	"cmd": [
		"pawncc.exe",
		"-i includes",
		"$file"
	],
	"path": "Location in which pawncc.exe is located."
}
```

### Code dependencies

Main thing you need to run this is a [Discord Connector plugin](https://github.com/maddinat0r/samp-discord-connector/releases) for the SA:MP and open.mp server.

Code also requires `sscanf` plugin in order to run. You can get it [here](https://github.com/Y-Less/sscanf/releases). Besides `sscanf`, code also has support for `crashdetect` plugin you can get [here](https://github.com/Zeex/samp-plugin-crashdetect/releases).

## Executing the code

The code supports both **SA:MP** and **open.mp** servers.

### SA:MP server
Go to the [Official SA:MP download site](https://www.sa-mp.com/download.php) and download the compressed archive with server files. Extract the files and modify your server configuration.

`server.cfg`:
```bat
lanmode 0
rcon_password 123
maxplayers 50
port 7777
hostname SA-MP 0.3 Server
gamemode0 ../discord_entry/d_botscript 1
announce 0
chatlogging 0
weburl www.sa-mp.com
onfoot_rate 40
incar_rate 40
weapon_rate 40
stream_distance 300.0
stream_rate 1000
maxnpc 0
logtimeformat [%H:%M:%S]
language English
discord_bot_token MYBOTTOKEN
```

You should replace `MYBOTTOKEN` with your application bot token. After you've saved your configuration, you can proceed to running the server by executing the SA:MP server.

### open.mp server
Same process - go to [open.mp download repo](https://github.com/openmultiplayer/open.mp/releases) and download the compressed archive that suits your device's operating system. Extract the files and modify your server configuration.

Default `config.json` should look like this:
```json
{
    "announce": true,
    "artwork": {
        "cdn": "",
        "enable": true,
        "models_path": "models"

        "use_timestamp": true
    },
    "max_bots": 0,
    "max_players": 50,
    "name": "open.mp server",
    "network": {
        "acks_limit": 3000,
        "aiming_sync_rate": 30,
        "allow_037_clients": true,
        "bind": "",
        "cookie_reseed_time": 300000,
        "in_vehicle_sync_rate": 30,
        "limits_ban_time": 60000,
        "message_hole_limit": 3000,
        "messages_limit": 500,
        "minimum_connection_time": 0,
        "mtu": 576,
        "multiplier": 10,
        "on_foot_sync_rate": 30,
        "player_marker_sync_rate": 2500,
        "player_timeout": 10000,
        "port": 7777,
        "public_addr": "",
        "stream_radius": 200.0,
        "stream_rate": 1000,
        "time_sync_rate": 30000,
        "use_lan_mode": false
    },
    "password": "",
    "pawn": {
        "legacy_plugins": [],
        "main_scripts": [
            "test 1"
        ],
        "side_scripts": []
    },
    "rcon": {
        "allow_teleport": false,
        "enable": false,
        "password": "changeme"
    },
    "sleep": 5.0,
    "use_dyn_ticks": true,
    "website": "open.mp"
}
```

You should add this part to the `.json` file and save it:

```json
"discord": {
	"bot_token": "MYBOTTOKEN",
	"intents": 131071
}
```

Also, modify the RCON password from `changeme` to something you prefer. You also need to change the `main_script` path.

`...`
```json
    "pawn": {
        "legacy_plugins": [],
        "main_scripts": [
            "../discord_entry/d_botscript 1"
        ],
        "side_scripts": []
    },
```
`...`

After that - you can proceed to running your **open.mp** server.
